                <h3>Mission Statement- Department of Mathematics:</h3>
            <p>
                The diversity of Mathematics as a field, and the vast variety of its applications 
                have revitalized its importance in the modern world. With the exponential growth 
                in the number of mathematical tools being employed globally for problem solving, 
                the potential of this discipline is profound. Keeping the growing need in mind, 
                this program trains students for both academia and industry simultaneously. 
                We aim to produce students having the potential to achieve the objectives 
                of this program and to enable them in choosing suitable careers which will 
                ultimately help them in becoming a capable and useful member of the academia 
                and the society.

                <p>
                    The department of Mathematics, established in 2019. The department is also privileged to have 
                    highly qualified, multi-cultural and devoted faculty with Ph.D. and MS / M.Phil degrees from 
                    the best national and international universities. Currently there are 12 faculty members in the 
                    Department. Our faculty has marked research profile in their research field. All classrooms are 
                    also fully equipped with necessary accessories with modern learning. Mathematics covers a range 
                    of expertise from the basic theoretical mathematical models to numerous advanced applied 
                    engineering related mathematical studies. Mathematics is taught with practical approach which 
                    will provide a sound foundation for the Engineering disciplines. Learners are made to do 
                    theoretical work of Mathematics with the help of programming languages such as C++ and MATLAB 
                    in well-equipped laboratory.</p><hr>
